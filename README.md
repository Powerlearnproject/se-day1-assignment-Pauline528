#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Enginering is the discipline of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software using systematic methods and principles. The importance of software engineering is that it enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
a)Introduction of Structured Programming (1960s-1970s):
    Structured programming introduced a disciplined approach to writing code, emphasizing clear, logical structures such as loops, conditionals, and subroutines. This 
    approach helped reduce complexity and errors, making programs easier to understand and maintain.
b)Development of Object-Oriented Programming (1980s):
    Object-oriented programming (OOP) introduced concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation. This paradigm allowed developers to model real-world 
    entities more naturally in code, promoting reusability and modularity, which greatly improved software design and maintenance.
c)Emergence of Agile Methodology (2000s):
   Agile methodology shifted the focus from traditional, linear development models (like Waterfall) to iterative, flexible processes. Agile promotes continuous feedback, 
   collaboration, and adaptive planning, enabling teams to respond quickly to changes and deliver high-quality software more efficiently.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) typically consists of the following phases:

1. Requirement Gathering and Analysis:
   - Description: In this phase, the needs and requirements of the users and stakeholders are collected and analyzed. This involves understanding what the software should accomplish and documenting detailed requirements to guide the development process.

2. Design:
   - Description: The design phase involves creating architectural and detailed designs for the software. This includes defining the system architecture, data structures, interfaces, and overall system layout. The goal is to plan how the software will be built based on the requirements.

3. Implementation (or Coding):
   - Description: During the implementation phase, the actual code for the software is written according to the design specifications. Developers write and test individual components, integrating them to form the complete system.

4. Testing:
   - Description: The testing phase involves systematically checking the software for defects and ensuring that it meets the requirements. Various testing methods, such as unit testing, integration testing, and system testing, are used to identify and fix issues before the software is released.
